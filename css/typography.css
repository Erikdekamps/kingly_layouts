/**
 * @file
 * Provides general typography styles for Kingly Layouts.
 *
 * This file is included when any typography options are applied via the
 * layout configuration. Individual styles are primarily set via inline
 * CSS to allow for granular control without generating an excessive
 * number of utility classes.
 *
 * It ensures that the base structure is ready for dynamic styles.
 */

/* No specific CSS rules are defined here for the new feature. */
/* Styles for typography are applied directly as inline styles */
/* or via @import rules generated dynamically based on user input. */
/* This file exists to register a library for typography and to ensure */
/* CSS variables for typography (if added in _variables.css) are available. */

/*
 * Example if you wanted base classes for some typography elements,
 * but for this feature, inline styles are preferred for flexibility.
 *
.kingly-layout--font-serif {
  font-family: var(--kingly-font-serif);
}
.kingly-layout--font-size-lg {
  font-size: var(--kingly-font-size-lg);
}
 */

/*
 * Note: If custom font imports were to be handled entirely via CSS,
 * this file might contain @import rules or CSS variables. However,
 * for dynamic URLs, PHP-level library attachment with data for
 * `hook_css_alter` is a more robust approach.
